  Security patches are essential for keeping your Android phone safe from malware, viruses, and other threats. Motorola is committed to providing its customers with the latest security patches, and Motorola Android phones receive regular security updates directly from Motorola.
</p>
<p>
  This is in contrast to other Android phones, which typically receive security updates from their manufacturers. Manufacturer updates can often be delayed, which means that your phone may be vulnerable to security threats for a longer period of time.
</p>
<p>
  Motorola's commitment to providing timely security updates is one of the things that makes Motorola Android phones a good choice for security-conscious users.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an example of how Motorola's security patches can protect your phone from a real-world threat:
</p>
<p>
  In 2015, a major security flaw was discovered in the Android operating system. This flaw allowed attackers to take control of Android phones by sending them specially crafted text messages. Motorola was quick to release a security patch for its Android phones that fixed this flaw.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, Motorola Android phones were not affected by this security flaw, while other Android phones were vulnerable to attack.
</p>
<p>
  This example shows how Motorola's commitment to providing timely security updates can help to protect your phone from real-world threats.
