  Privacy is a major concern for many Android users, and Android 13 takes several steps to improve user privacy and security. One of the most important new features in Android 13 is the ability to control which apps have access to your location, microphone, and camera. This gives you more control over your personal data and helps to prevent apps from tracking your movements or accessing your sensitive information without your consent.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Granular permissions:</strong> Android 13 gives you more granular control over the permissions that you grant to apps. For example, you can now choose to allow an app to access your location only while you are using the app, or you can choose to deny an app access to your camera altogether.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Privacy dashboard:</strong> Android 13 includes a new privacy dashboard that makes it easier to see how your data is being used. The privacy dashboard shows you which apps have accessed your location, microphone, and camera in the past 24 hours. It also shows you which apps have access to your personal information, such as your contacts and messages.
  </li>
</ul>
